		-It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
		-It compresses data by itself.
	http2

2) Object
		An object refers to any item, either in the physical or virtual world. For example, a computer is considered an object in the physical world. 
		In the virtual world, a document, file, folder, icon, picture are all considered objects
	In javascript an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. 
	A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
